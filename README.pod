=head1 NAME

Syntax::Feature::Io - Provides IO::All

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use syntax qw( io );

    my @own_lines = io(__FILE__)->getlines;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a syntax feature extension for L<syntax> providing L<IO::All>.

Not much additional use is provided, besides much easier access if you are
already using L<syntax> in one way or another.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 install

    $class->install( %arguments )

Used by L<syntax> to install the extension in the requesting namespace.
Only the arguments C<into> and C<options> are recognized.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 -import

    use syntax io => { -import => [-strict] };

You can use this option to pass import flags to L<IO::All>. Since this is
the option you'll most likely use, if any, you can skip the hash reference
and provide the import list directly if you wish:

    use syntax io => [-strict];

Please see L<IO::All/USAGE> for documentation on the import arguments.

=head2 -as

    use syntax io => { -as => 'IO' };

    my @own_lines = IO(__FILE)->getlines;

Set the name of the import.
